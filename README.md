# Math Projects - Jupyter Notebook 

Welcome to the **Math Projects** repository, a dedicated section of my professional portfolio showcasing various math-focused projects. Here, you'll find Jupyter Notebooks that explore a range of math concepts, in areas such as linear algebra, calculus, and more. Each project is designed as a study tool, or demonstration of practical applications by providing examples and solutions that can serve those faced with similar problems and various libraries such as math, numpy, and others are used.

Whether you're a fellow mathematician, an educator, or simply curious about math, I hope these Python projects offer value to you and inspire further exploration.

## 1. Calculator of Matrices

### Project Objective

Develop a matrix calculator capable of performing all fundamental and advanced operations of linear algebra, providing an accessible and efficient tool for students, teachers, and researchers. The calculator will allow executing operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, determinants, inverses, transpositions, decompositions, and other matrix transformations. Additionally, it will facilitate the understanding and solving of mathematical problems related to linear equation systems, vector spaces, and applications in various scientific and technological fields.

### Focus

1. **Educational**: Help students and teachers visualize and understand matrix operations.
2. **Research**: Serve as a support tool for solving complex problems in mathematical, physical, and engineering research.
3. **Efficiency and Usability**: Provide an intuitive interface so that any user can easily perform linear algebra operations.
