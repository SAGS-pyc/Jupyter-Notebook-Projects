This is a repository that is part of my professional portfolio and contains some projects only related to mathematics.

## 1. Calculator of Matrices

### Project Objective

Develop a matrix calculator capable of performing all fundamental and advanced operations of linear algebra, providing an accessible and efficient tool for students, teachers, and researchers. The calculator will allow executing operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, determinants, inverses, transpositions, decompositions, and other matrix transformations. Additionally, it will facilitate the understanding and solving of mathematical problems related to linear equation systems, vector spaces, and applications in various scientific and technological fields.

### Focus

1. **Educational**: Help students and teachers visualize and understand matrix operations.
2. **Research**: Serve as a support tool for solving complex problems in mathematical, physical, and engineering research.
3. **Efficiency and Usability**: Provide an intuitive interface so that any user can easily perform linear algebra operations.
